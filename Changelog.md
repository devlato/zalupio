# 2.0.0 - 2015-07-16
This is a new major version of Aglio, and as such has some breaking changes.
High-level changes in this release:

* Use [Drafter.js](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter.js) to support [MSON](https://github.com/apiaryio/mson) via generated request/response bodies and schemas.
* Add support for [theme engines](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio#using-custom-themes).
* Use [Olio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio/tree/olio-theme#readme) as the new default theme engine.
* API and resource group description headers are now included in the navigation bar.
* Server mode can now serve static files, which is useful if your documentation contains images.
* Fixes to how resource and action parameters are handled.

For more detailed information, see the beta releases below.

Effort was taken to prevent backward-incompatible changes. Here is a list of
things that **will break** if you used them in 1.x.

Binary:
* It is no longer possible to list templates (`aglio -l`). You may use `npm list -g | grep aglio-theme` to list all installed theme engine packages instead. Refer to individual theme documentation for possible theme engine options.

Library:
* The `aglio.getTemplates` function has been **removed**.

Templates:
* The multi-page layouts have been **removed**. Please open an issue if you would like to see them in the new theme engine.
* The collapsed navigation layouts have been **removed**. This is now in the default theme and handled automatically based on browser window height.

The following are translated internally and will not break, but are suggested updates:

Binary:
* The `-t` option is now shorthand for `--theme` instead of `--template`.
* The `--full-width` and `--condense-nav` parameters are now `--theme-full-width` and `--theme-condense-nav` in the default theme engine.

Library:
* Passing a string as the options to `render` and `renderFile` will still work if it is a known variant: `default`, `flatly`, `slate`, `cyborg` or one of the collapsed versions of those. If it is a path and the file exists, then it will use it as a custom `themeLayout` option. Otherwise it will set the theme engine name. :dizzy_face:
* You should use `options.theme` instead of `options.template`.
* You should use `options.themeVariables = 'flatly'` to set the color variation.
* You should use `options.themeTemplate = '/path/to/layout.jade'` to set the layout template.

Thank you to all the contributors and testers for helping to make this an awesome release! :beers:
